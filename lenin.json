Long before me bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this class struggle and bourgeois economists, the economic anatomy of classes.

Production by an isolated individual outside society ... is as much of an absurdity as is the development of language without individuals living together and talking to each other.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)\n\u00a0\nIt seems to be correct to begin with the real and the concrete, with the real precondition, thus to begin, in economics, with e.g. the population, which is the foundation and the subject of the entire social act of production. However, on closer examination this proves false. The population is an abstraction if I leave out, for example, the classes of which it is composed. ... if I were to begin with the population, this would be a chaotic conception of the whole, and I would then, by means of further determination, move analytically towards ever more simple concepts, from the imagined concrete towards ever thinner abstractions until I had arrived at the simplest determinations. From there the journey would have to be retraced until I had finally arrived at the population again, but this time not as the chaotic conception of a whole, but as a rich totality of many determinations and relations.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)\n\u00a0\nHuman anatomy contains a key to the anatomy of the ape. \r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)\n\u00a0\nIn all forms of society there is one specific kind of production which predominates over the rest, ... a general illumination which bathes all the other colours and modifies their particularity.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)\n\u00a0\nRelations of personal dependence are the first social forms in which human productive capacity develops only to a slight extent and at isolated points. Personal independence founded on objective dependence is the second great form, in which a system of general social metabolism, of universal relations, of all-round needs and universal capacities is formed for the first time. Free individuality, based on the universal development of individuals and on their subordination of their communal, social productivity as their social wealth, is the third stage.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)\n\u00a0\nSociety does not consist of individuals, but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)\n\u00a0\nCapital and labour relate to each other here like money and commodity; the former is the general form of wealth, the other only the substance destined for immediate consumption. Capital\u2019s ceaseless striving towards the general form of wealth drives labour beyond the limits of its natural paltriness, and thus creates the material elements for the development of the rich individuality which is as all-sided in its production as in its consumption, and whose labour also therefore appears no longer as labour, but as the full development of activity itself, in which natural necessity in its direct form has disappeared; because natural need has been replaced by historically produced need. This is why capital is productive; i.e. an essential relation for the development of the social productive forces. It ceases to exist as such only where the development of these productive forces themselves encounters its barrier in capital itself.\r\nMarx, 1The Grundrisse (1857)\n\u00a0\nThe pay of the common soldier is also reduced to a minimum \u2014 determined purely by the production costs necessary to procure him. But he exchanges the performance of his services not for capital, but for the revenue of the state.\r\nIn bourgeois society itself, all exchange of personal services for revenue \u2014 including labour for personal consumption, cooking, sewing etc., garden work etc., up to and including all of the unproductive classes, civil servants, physicians, lawyers, scholars etc. \u2014 belongs under this rubric, within this category. All menial servants etc. By means of their services \u2014 often coerced \u2014 all these workers, from the least to the highest, obtain for themselves a share of the surplus product, of the capitalist\u2019s revenue.\r\nBut it does not occur to anyone to think that by means of the exchange of his revenue for such services, i.e. through private consumption, the capitalist posits himself as capitalist. Rather, he thereby spends the fruits of his capital. It does not change the nature of the relation that the proportions in which revenue is exchanged for this kind of living labour are themselves determined by the general laws of production.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)\n\u00a0\nFor example, when the peasant takes a wandering tailor, of the kind that existed in times past, into his house, and gives him the material to make clothes with. ... The man who takes the cloth I supplied to him and makes me an article of clothing out of it gives me a use value. But instead of giving it directly in objective form, he gives it in the form of activity. I give him a completed use value; he completes another for me. The difference between previous, objectified labour and living, present labour here appears as a merely formal difference between the different tenses of labour, at one time in the perfect and at another in the present.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)\n\u00a0\nThe separation of public works from the state, and their migration into the domain of the works undertaken by capital itself, indicates the degree to which the real community has constituted itself in the form of capital.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)\n\u00a0\nIn the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness.\r\nMarx, Preface to the Critique of Political Economy (1859)\n\u00a0\nThe mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.\r\nMarx, Preface to the Critique of Political Economy (1859)\n\u00a0\nAt a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or \u2013 this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms \u2013 with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto.  From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.\r\nMarx, Preface to the Critique of Political Economy (1859)\n\u00a0\nIn studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic \u2013 in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out.\r\nMarx, Preface to the Critique of Political Economy (1859)\n\u00a0\nNo social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.  Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation.\r\nMarx, Preface to the Critique of Political Economy (1859)\n\u00a0\nThere is in every social formation a particular branch of production which determines the position and importance of all the others, and the relations obtaining in this branch accordingly determine the relations of all other branches as well. It is as though light of a particular hue were cast upon everything, tingeing all other colours and modifying their specific features.\r\nMarx, Preface to the Critique of Political Economy (1859)\n\u00a0\nI have tried to dispel the misunderstanding arising out of the impression that by \u2018party\u2019 I meant a \u2018League\u2019 that expired eight years ago, or an editorial board that was disbanded twelve years ago.

This, however, is possible only in a society in which the great mass of the produce of labour takes the form of commodities, in which, consequently, the dominant relation between man and man, is that of owners of commodities.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter One (1867)\n\u00a0\nA commodity appears, at first sight, a very trivial thing, and easily understood. Its analysis shows that it is, in reality, a very queer thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter One (1867)\n\u00a0\nthe existence of the things qua commodities, and the value-relation between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities, have absolutely no connection with their physical properties and with the material relations arising therefrom. There it is a definite social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things. ... This I call the Fetishism ... of commodities.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter One (1867)\n\u00a0\nMan\u2019s reflections on the forms of social life, and consequently, also, his scientific analysis of those forms, take a course directly opposite to that of their actual historical development. He begins, post festum, with the results of the process of development ready to hand before him.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter One (1867)\n\u00a0\nThe categories of bourgeois economy consist of such like forms. They are forms of thought expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite, historically determined mode of production, viz., the production of commodities. The whole mystery of commodities, all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labour as long as they take the form of commodities, vanishes therefore, so soon as we come to other forms of production.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter One (1867)\n\u00a0\nPolitical Economy has indeed analysed, however incompletely, value and its magnitude, and has discovered what lies beneath these forms. But it has never once asked the question why labour is represented by the value of its product and labour-time by the magnitude of that value. These formulae, which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they belong to a state of society, in which the process of production has the mastery over man, instead of being controlled by him, such formulae appear to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a self-evident necessity imposed by Nature as productive labour itself.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter One (1867)\n\u00a0\nIt is with man as with commodities. Since he comes into the world neither with a looking glass in his hand, nor as a Fichtean philosopher, to whom \u2018I am I\u2019 is sufficient, man first sees and recognises himself in other men. Peter only establishes his own identity as a man by first comparing himself with Paul as being of like kind. And thereby Paul, just as he stands in his Pauline personality, becomes to Peter the type of the genus homo.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter One (1867)\r\n\n\u00a0\nThe price or money-form of commodities is, like their form of value generally, a form quite distinct from their palpable bodily form; it is, therefore, a purely ideal or mental form\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 3 (1867)\n\u00a0\nModern society, which, soon after its birth, pulled Plutus by the hair of his head from the bowels of the earth, greets gold as its Holy Grail, as the glittering incarnation of the very principle of its own life.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 3 (1867)\n\u00a0\nWhile the miser is merely a capitalist gone mad, the capitalist is a rational miser.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 4 (1867)\n\u00a0\nCapital is money: Capital is commodities. ... Because it is value, it has acquired the occult quality of being able to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 4 (1867)\n\u00a0\nLabour is, in the first place, a process in which both man and Nature participate, and in which man of his own accord starts, regulates, and controls the material re-actions between himself and Nature. He opposes himself to Nature as one of her own forces, ....\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 7 (1867)\n\u00a0\nAs capitalist, he is only capital personified. His soul is the soul of capital. But capital has one single life impulse, the tendency to create value and surplus-value, to make its constant factor, the means of production, absorb the greatest possible amount of surplus-labour. Capital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 10 (1867)\n\u00a0\nCapital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks. The time during which the labourer works, is the time during which the capitalist consumes the labour-power he has purchased of him.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 10 (1867)\n\u00a0\nIn the United States of North America, every independent movement\r\nof the workers was paralysed so long as slavery disfigured a part of the\r\nRepublic. Labour cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the\r\nblack it is branded.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 10 (1867)\n\u00a0\nIn every stockjobbing swindle every one knows that some time or other the crash must come, but every one hopes that it may fall on the head of his neighbour, after he himself has caught the shower of gold and placed it in safety. Apr\u00e8s moi le d\u00e9luge! is the watchword of every capitalist and of every capitalist nation. Hence Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the labourer, unless under compulsion from society. [Marx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 10 (1867)\n\u00a0\nmachinery has greatly increased the number of well-to-do idlers.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 15 (1867)\n\u00a0\nCapitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth-the soil and the labourer.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 15 (1867)\n\u00a0\na schoolmaster is a productive labourer when, in addition to belabouring the heads of his scholars, he works like a horse to enrich the school proprietor. That the latter has laid out his capital in a teaching factory, instead of in a sausage factory, does not alter the relation.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 16 (1867)\n\u00a0\nOn the level plain, simple mounds look like hills; and the imbecile flatness of the present bourgeoisie is to be measured by the altitude of its great intellects..\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 16 (1867)\n\u00a0\nThat which comes directly face to face with the possessor of money on the market, is in fact not labour, but the labourer. What the latter sells is his labour-power. As soon as his labour actually begins, it has already ceased to belong to him; it can therefore no longer be sold by him. Labour is the substance, and the immanent measure of value, but has itself no value. ... That in their appearance things often represent themselves in inverted form is pretty well known in every science except Political Economy\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 19 (1867)\n\u00a0\nA rise in the price of labour, as a consequence of accumulation of capital, only means, in fact, that the length and weight of the golden chain the wage-worker has already forged for himself, allow of a relaxation of the tension of it.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter 25 (1867)\n\u00a0\nCentralization of the means of production and socialization of labor at last reach a point where they become incompatible with their capitalist integument. Thus integument is burst asunder.

Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?\r\nEngels, On Authority, (1872)\n\u00a0\nOf course the method of presentation must differ in form from\r\nthat of inquiry.

In France and in England the bourgeoisie had conquered political power. Thenceforth, the class-struggle, practically as well as theoretically, took on more and more outspoken and threatening forms. It sounded the knell of scientific bourgeois economy. It was thenceforth no longer a question, whether this theorem or that was true, but whether it was useful to capital or harmful, expedient or inexpedient, politically dangerous or not. In place of disinterested inquirers, there were hired prize fighters; in place of genuine scientific research, the bad conscience and the evil intent of apologetic.\r\nMarx, Afterword to the Second German Edition of Capital (1873)\n\u00a0\nOf course the method of presentation must differ in form from that of inquiry. The latter has to appropriate the material in detail, to analyse its different forms of development, to trace out their inner connexion.

Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby.\r\nMarx, Critique of the Gotha Program (1875)\n\u00a0\nIn a higher phase of communist society, ... \u2014 only then then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\r\nMarx, Critique of the Gotha Program (1875)\n\u00a0\nIt is altogether self-evident that, to be able to fight at all, the working class must organize itself at home as a class and that its own country is the immediate arena of its struggle \u2014 insofar as its class struggle is national, not in substance, but, as the Communist Manifesto says, \u2018in form\u2019.\r\nMarx, Critique of the Gotha Program (1875)\n\u00a0\nBetween capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\r\nMarx, Critique of the Gotha Program (1875)\n\u00a0\nEvery step of real movement is more important than a dozen programmes.\r\nMarx, Letter to Bracke (1875)\n\u00a0\nThe whole Darwinian theory of the struggle for existence is simply the transference from society to animate nature of Hobbes\u2019 theory of the war of every man against every man and the bourgeois economic theory of competition, along with the Malthusian theory of population. This feat having been accomplished \u2013 (as indicated under (1) I dispute its unqualified justification, especially where the Malthusian theory is concerned) \u2013 the same theories are next transferred back again from organic nature to history and their validity as eternal laws of human society declared to have been proved..\r\nMarx, Enegls to Lavrov (1875)\n\u00a0\nLet us not, however, flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human victories over nature. For each such victory nature takes its revenge on us. Each victory, it is true, in the first place brings about the results we expected, but in the second and third places it has quite different, unforeseen effects which only too often cancel the first. The people who, in Mesopotamia, Greece, Asia Minor and elsewhere, destroyed the forests to obtain cultivable land, never dreamed that by removing along with the forests the collecting centres and reservoirs of moisture they were laying the basis for the present forlorn state of those countries. When the Italians of the Alps used up the pine forests on the southern slopes, so carefully cherished on the northern slopes, they had no inkling that by doing so they were cutting at the roots of the dairy industry in their region; they had still less inkling that they were thereby depriving their mountain springs of water for the greater part of the year, and making it possible for them to pour still more furious torrents on the plains during the rainy seasons. Those who spread the potato in Europe were not aware that with these farinaceous tubers they were at the same time spreading scrofula. Thus at every step we are reminded that we by no means rule over nature like a conqueror over a foreign people, like someone standing outside nature \u2013 but that we, with flesh, blood and brain, belong to nature, and exist in its midst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact\r\nthat we have the advantage over all other creatures of being able to learn its laws and apply them correctly.\r\nEngels, The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man (1876)\n\u00a0\nLabour is the source of all wealth, the political economists assert. And it really is the source \u2014  next to nature, which supplies it with the material that it converts into wealth. But it is even infinitely more than this. It is the prime basic condition for all human existence, and this to such an extent that, in a sense, we have to say that labour created man himself.\r\nEngels, The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man (1876)\n\u00a0\nWhen we consider and reflect upon nature at large or the history of mankind or our own intellectual activity, at first we see the picture of an endless entanglement of relations and reactions in which nothing remains what, where and as it was, but everything moves, changes, comes into being and passes away. This primitive, naive but intrinsically correct conception of the world is that of ancient Greek philosophy, and was first clearly formulated by Heraclitus: everything is and is not, for everything is fluid, is constantly changing, constantly coming into being and passing away.\u00a0\nBut this conception, correctly as it expresses the general character of the picture of appearances as a whole, does not suffice to explain the details of which this picture is made up, and so long as we do not understand these, we have not a clear idea of the whole picture. In order to understand these details we must detach them from their natural or historical connection and examine each one separately, its nature, special causes, effects, etc.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nOnly sound common sense, respectable fellow that he is, in the homely realm of his own four walls, has very wonderful adventures directly he ventures out into the wide world of research.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nNature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern science that it has furnished this proof with very rich materials increasing daily.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nall past history was the history of class struggles; that these warring classes of society are always the products of the modes of production and of exchange.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nthe principles are not the starting-point of the investigation, but its final result; they are not applied to nature and human history, but abstracted from them, it is not nature and the realm of man which conform to these principles, but the principles are only valid in so far as they are in conformity with nature and history. That is the only materialist conception of the matter.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nFreedom does not consist in any dreamt-of independence from natural laws, but in the knowledge of these laws, and in the possibility this gives of systematically making them work towards definite ends.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nThe idea that political acts, grand performances of state, are decisive in history is as old as written history itself, and is the main reason why so little material has been preserved for us in regard to the really progressive evolution of the peoples which has taken place quietly, in the background, behind these noisy scenes on the stage.\r\nEngels, The Theory of Force (1877)\n\u00a0\nNeither of us cares a straw for popularity. Let me cite one proof of this: such was my aversion to the personality cult that at the time of the International, when plagued by numerous moves \u2013 originating from various countries \u2013 to accord me public honour, I never allowed one of these to enter the domain of publicity, nor did I ever reply to them, save with an occasional snub. When Engels and I first joined the secret communist society, we did so only on condition that anything conducive to a superstitious belief in authority be eliminated from the Rules.\r\nMarx, Letter to Blos (1877)\n\u00a0\nIt is becoming equally imperative to bring the individual spheres of knowledge into the correct connection with one another. In doing so, however, natural science enters the field of theory and here the methods of empiricism will not work, here only theoretical thinking can be of assistance. But theoretical thinking is an innate quality only as regards natural capacity. This natural capacity must be developed, improved, and for its improvement there is as yet no other means than the study of previous philosophy.\r\nEngels, On Dialectics (1878)\n\u00a0\nDialectics constitutes the most important form of thinking for present-day natural science, for it alone offers the analogue for, and thereby the method of explaining, the evolutionary processes occurring in nature, inter-connections in general, and transitions from one field of investigation to another.\r\nEngels, On Dialectics (1878)\n\u00a0\nThe Greeks were not yet advanced enough to dissect, analyse nature \u2014 nature is still viewed as a whole, in general. The universal connection of natural phenomena is not proved in regard to particular; to the Greeks it is the result of direct contemplation. Herein lies the inadequacy of Greek philosophy, ... But herein also lies its superiority over all its subsequent metaphysical opponents. If in regard to the Greeks metaphysics was right in particulars, in regard to metaphysics the Greeks were right in general.\r\nEngels, On Dialectics (1878)\n\u00a0\nFor nearly 40 years we have raised to prominence the idea of the class struggle as the immediate driving force of history, and particularly the class struggle between bourgeois and the proletariat as the great lever of the modern social revolution; ... At the founding of the International, we expressly formulated the battle cry: The emancipation of the working class must be the work of the working class itself.\r\nMarx and Engels, Strategy and Tactics of the Class Struggle (1879) \n\u00a0\nNature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern\r\nscience that it has furnished this proof with very rich materials increasingly\r\ndaily, and thus has shown that, in the last resort, Nature works dialectically\r\nand not metaphysically; that she does not move in the eternal oneness of\r\na perpetually recurring circle, but goes through a real historical evolution.\r\nEngels, Socialism: Utopian & Scientific (1880)\n\u00a0\nThe materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and, next to production, the exchange of things produced, is the basis of all social structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced, and how the products are exchanged. From this point of view, the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men\u2019s brains, not in men\u2019s better insights into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange.\r\nEngels, Socialism: Utopian & Scientific (1880)\n\u00a0\nTo save the Russian commune, a Russian revolution is needed.\r\nMarx, Letter To Vera Zasulich (1881)\n\u00a0\nThe history of the decline of primitive communities (it would be a mistake to place them all on the same level; as in geological formations, these historical forms contain a whole series of primary, secondary, tertiary types, etc.) has still to be written. All we have seen so far are some rather meagre outlines. But in any event the research has advanced far enough to establish that: (1) the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, etc. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies; (2) the causes of their decline stem from economic facts which prevented them from passing a certain stage of development\r\nEngels, Letter To Vera Zasulich (1881)\n\u00a0\nNot only can we manage very well without the interference of the capitalist class in the great industries of the country, but that their interference is becoming more and more a nuisance.\r\nEngels, Social Classes - Necessary and Superfluous (1881)\n\u00a0\nI do not proceed from \u201cconcepts,\u201d hence neither from the \u201cconcept of value,\u201d and am therefore in no way concerned to \u201cdivide\u201d it. What I proceed from is the simplest social form in which the product of labour presents itself in contemporary society, and this is the \u201ccommodity.\u201d This I analyse, initially in the form in which it appears.\r\nMarx, Notes on Adolph Wagner\u2019s \u201cLehrbuch der politischen \u00d6konomie\u201d (1881)\n\u00a0\nWhat is known as \u2018Marxism\u2019 in France is, indeed, an altogether peculiar product \u2014 so much so that Marx once said to Lafargue: \u2018Ce qu\u2019il y a de certain c\u2019est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxiste.\u2019 [If anything is certain, it is that I myself am not a Marxist]\r\nEngels, Letter to Eduard Bernstein (1882)\n\u00a0\nJust as Darwin discovered the law of development or organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history: the simple fact, hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of ideology, that mankind must first of all eat, drink, have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, art, religion, etc.; that therefore the production of the immediate material means, and consequently the degree of economic development attained by a given people or during a given epoch, form the foundation upon which the state institutions, the legal conceptions, art, and even the ideas on religion, of the people concerned have been evolved, and in the light of which they must, therefore, be explained, instead of vice versa, as had hitherto been the case.\r\nEngels, Speech at the Graveside of Karl Marx (1883)\n\u00a0\nIt is precisely the alteration of nature by men, not solely nature as such, which is the most essential and immediate basis of human thought.\r\nEngels, Dialectics of Nature (1883)\n\u00a0\nIt is, therefore, from the history of nature and human society that the laws of dialectics are abstracted. For they are nothing but the most general laws of these two aspects of historical development, as well as of thought itself.\r\nAnd indeed they can be reduced in the main to three: \r\n \u00a0 The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa;\r\n \u00a0 The law of the interpenetration of opposites;\r\n \u00a0 The law of the negation of the negation.\r\nEngels, Dialectics of Nature (1883)\n\u00a0\nEvery individual capital forms, however, but an individualised fraction, a fraction endowed with individual life, as it were, of the aggregate social capital, just as every individual capitalist is but an individual element of the capitalist class.\r\nMarx, Capital Volume II (1885)\n\u00a0\nIt was Marx who had first discovered the great law of motion of history, the law according to which all historical struggles, whether they proceed in the political, religious, philosophical or some other ideological domain, are in fact only the more or less clear expression of struggles of social classes, and that the existence and thereby the collisions, too, between these classes are in turn conditioned by the degree of development of their economic position, by the mode of their production and of their exchange determined by it. This law, which has the same significance for history as the law of the transformation of energy has for natural science.\r\nEngels, Preface to The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1885)\n\u00a0\nThe economic facts, which have so far played no role or only a contemptible one in the writing of history, are, at least in the modern world, a decisive historical force; that they form the basis of the origination of the present-day class antagonisms; that these class antagonisms, in the countries where they have become fully developed, thanks to large-scale industry, hence especially in England, are in their turn the basis of the formation of political parties and of party struggles, and thus of all political history. Marx had not only arrived at the same view, but had already, in the Deutsche-Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher (1844), generalized it to the effect that, speaking generally, it is not the state which conditions and regulates the civil society at all, but civil society which conditions and regulates the state, and, consequently, that policy and its history are to be explained from the economic relations and their development, and not vice versa.\r\nEngels, On the History of the Communist League (1885)\n\u00a0\nCommunism now no longer meant the concoction, by means of the imagination, of an ideal society as perfect as possible, but insight into the nature, the conditions and the consequent general aims of the struggle waged by the proletariat.\r\nEngels, On the History of the Communist League (1885)\n\u00a0\nThe doctrine of Hegel, taken as a whole, left plenty of room for giving shelter to the most diverse practical party views. And in the theoretical Germany of that time, two things above all were practical: religion and politics. Whoever placed the chief emphasis on the Hegelian system could be fairly conservative in both spheres; whoever regarded the dialectical method as the main thing could belong to the most extreme opposition, both in politics and religion.\r\nEngels, Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy (1886)\n\u00a0\nThe great basic question of all philosophy, especially of more recent philosophy, is that concerning the relation of thinking and being. ... \r\nThe answers which the philosophers gave to this question split them into two great camps. Those who asserted the primacy of spirit to nature and, therefore, in the last instance, assumed world creation in some form or other \u2014 and among the philosophers, Hegel, for example, this creation often becomes still more intricate and impossible than in Christianity \u2014 comprised the camp of idealism. The others, who regarded nature as primary, belong to the various schools of materialism.\r\nEngels, Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy (1886)\n\u00a0\nThat which is willed happens but rarely; in the majority of instances the numerous desired ends cross and conflict with one another, or these ends themselves are from the outset incapable of realisation, or the means of attaining them are insufficient. thus the conflicts of innumerable individual wills and individual actions in the domain of history produce a state of affairs entirely analogous to that prevailing in the realm of unconscious nature.\r\nEngels, Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy (1886)\n\u00a0\nThe only war left for Prussia-Germany to wage will be a world war, a world war, moreover of an extent the violence hitherto unimagined. Eight to ten million soldiers will be at each other\u2019s throats and in the process they will strip Europe barer than a swarm of locusts. The depredations of the Years\u2019 War compressed into three to four years and extended over the entire continent; famine, disease, the universal lapse into barbarism.\r\nEngels, Introduction to Borkheim (1887)\n\u00a0\nAccording to the materialist conception of history, the ultimately determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life. Other than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted. Hence if somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the only determining one, he transforms that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase.\r\n[Engels, Letter to J Bloch (1890)\n\u00a0\nTo my mind, the so-called \u2018socialist society\u2019 is not anything immutable. Like all other social formations, it should be conceived in a state of constant flux and change. It\u2019s crucial difference from the present order consists naturally in production organized on the basis of common ownership by the nation of all means of production. To begin this reorganization tomorrow, but performing it gradually, seems to me quite feasible. That our workers are capable of it is borne out by their many producer and consumer cooperatives which, whenever they\u2019re not deliberately ruined by the police, are equally well and far more honestly run than the bourgeois stock companies.\r\nEngels, Letter to Otto Von Boenigk (1890)\n\u00a0\nThe day when we are in the majority, what the French army did instinctively in not firing on the people will be repeated in our country quite consciously. Yes, whatever the frightened bourgeois say, we are able to calculate the moment when we shall have the majority of the people behind us; our ideas are making headway everywhere, as much among teachers, doctors, lawyers, etc. as among the workers. If we had to start wielding power tomorrow, we should need engineers, chemists, agronomists. Well, it is my conviction that we would have a good many of them behind us already. In five or ten years we shall have more of them than we need.\r\nEngels, Interview with Le Figaro (1893)\n\u00a0\nAll science would be superfluous if the outward appearance and the essence of things directly coincided.\r\nMarx, published by Engels Capital, Volume III (1894)\n\u00a0\nJust as the savage must wrestle with Nature to satisfy his wants, to maintain and reproduce life, so must civilised man, and he must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of production. With his development this realm of physical necessity expands as a result of his wants; but, at the same time, the forces of production which satisfy these wants also increase. Freedom in this field can only consist in socialised man, the associated producers, rationally regulating their interchange with Nature, bringing it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by the blind forces of Nature; and achieving this with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favourable to, and worthy of, their human nature. But it nonetheless still remains a realm of necessity. Beyond it begins that development of human energy which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working-day is its basic prerequisite.\r\nMarx, published by Engels Capital, Volume III (1894)\n\u00a0\nWhat we understand by the economic conditions which we regard as the determining basis of the history of society are the methods by which human beings in a given society produce their means of subsistence and exchange the products among themselves (in so far as division of labour exists).

Long before me bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this class struggle and bourgeois economists, the economic anatomy of classes. What I did that was new was to prove:(1) that the existence of classes is only bound up with the particular, historical phases in the development of production,(2) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat,(3) that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society.\r\nMarx, Letter to Weydemeyer (1852)", "History is the judge \u2014 its executioner, the proletarian.\r\nMarx, Speech at Anniversary of The People\u2019s Paper (1856)", "The Afghans are a brave, hardy, and independent race; they follow pastoral or agricultural occupations only ...

Production by an isolated individual outside society ... is as much of an absurdity as is the development of language without individuals living together and talking to each other.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)", "It seems to be correct to begin with the real and the concrete, with the real precondition, thus to begin, in economics, with e.g. the population, which is the foundation and the subject of the entire social act of production. However, on closer examination this proves false. The population is an abstraction if I leave out, for example, the classes of which it is composed. ... if I were to begin with the population, this would be a chaotic conception of the whole, and I would then, by means of further determination, move analytically towards ever more simple concepts, from the imagined concrete towards ever thinner abstractions until I had arrived at the simplest determinations.

Personal independence founded on objective dependence is the second great form, in which a system of general social metabolism, of universal relations, of all-round needs and universal capacities is formed for the first time. Free individuality, based on the universal development of individuals and on their subordination of their communal, social productivity as their social wealth, is the third stage.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)", "Society does not consist of individuals, but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)", "Capital and labour relate to each other here like money and commodity; the former is the general form of wealth, the other only the substance destined for immediate consumption. Capital\u2019s ceaseless striving towards the general form of wealth drives labour beyond the limits of its natural paltriness, and thus creates the material elements for the development of the rich individuality which is as all-sided in its production as in its consumption, and whose labour also therefore appears no longer as labour, but as the full development of activity itself, in which natural necessity in its direct form has disappeared; because natural need has been replaced by historically produced need. This is why capital is productive; i.e. an essential relation for the development of the social productive forces. It ceases to exist as such only where the development of these productive forces themselves encounters its barrier in capital itself.\r\nMarx, 1The Grundrisse (1857)", "The pay of the common soldier is also reduced to a minimum \u2014 determined purely by the production costs necessary to procure him. But he exchanges the performance of his services not for capital, but for the revenue of the state.\r\nIn bourgeois society itself, all exchange of personal services for revenue \u2014 including labour for personal consumption, cooking, sewing etc., garden work etc., up to and including all of the unproductive classes, civil servants, physicians, lawyers, scholars etc. \u2014 belongs under this rubric, within this category.

Rather, he thereby spends the fruits of his capital. It does not change the nature of the relation that the proportions in which revenue is exchanged for this kind of living labour are themselves determined by the general laws of production.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)", "For example, when the peasant takes a wandering tailor, of the kind that existed in times past, into his house, and gives him the material to make clothes with. ... The man who takes the cloth I supplied to him and makes me an article of clothing out of it gives me a use value. But instead of giving it directly in objective form, he gives it in the form of activity. I give him a completed use value; he completes another for me. The difference between previous, objectified labour and living, present labour here appears as a merely formal difference between the different tenses of labour, at one time in the perfect and at another in the present.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)", "The separation of public works from the state, and their migration into the domain of the works undertaken by capital itself, indicates the degree to which the real community has constituted itself in the form of capital.\r\nMarx, The Grundrisse (1857)", "In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production.

From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.\r\nMarx, Preface to the Critique of Political Economy (1859)", "In studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic \u2013 in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out.\r\nMarx, Preface to the Critique of Political Economy (1859)", "No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.  Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation.\r\nMarx, Preface to the Critique of Political Economy (1859)", "There is in every social formation a particular branch of production which determines the position and importance of all the others, and the relations obtaining in this branch accordingly determine the relations of all other branches as well.

But it has never once asked the question why labour is represented by the value of its product and labour-time by the magnitude of that value. These formulae, which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they belong to a state of society, in which the process of production has the mastery over man, instead of being controlled by him, such formulae appear to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a self-evident necessity imposed by Nature as productive labour itself.\r\nMarx, Capital, Volume I, Chapter One (1867)", "It is with man as with commodities. Since he comes into the world neither with a looking glass in his hand, nor as a Fichtean philosopher, to whom \u2018I am I\u2019 is sufficient, man first sees and recognises himself in other men.

It was thenceforth no longer a question, whether this theorem or that was true, but whether it was useful to capital or harmful, expedient or inexpedient, politically dangerous or not. In place of disinterested inquirers, there were hired prize fighters; in place of genuine scientific research, the bad conscience and the evil intent of apologetic.\r\nMarx, Afterword to the Second German Edition of Capital (1873)", "Of course the method of presentation must differ in form from that of inquiry. The latter has to appropriate the material in detail, to analyse its different forms of development, to trace out their inner connexion. Only after this work is done, can the actual movement be adequately described. If this is done successfully, if the life of the subject-matter is ideally reflected as in a mirror, then it may appear as if we had before us a mere a priori construction.\r\nMarx, Afterword to the Second German Edition of Capital (1873)", "The bourgeoisie is just as necessary a precondition for the socialist revolution as is the proletariat itself.\r\nMarx, On Social Relations in Russia (1874)", "... defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged after prolonged birth pangs from capitalist society. Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby.\r\nMarx, Critique of the Gotha Program (1875)", "In a higher phase of communist society, ... \u2014 only then then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\r\nMarx, Critique of the Gotha Program (1875)", "It is altogether self-evident that, to be able to fight at all, the working class must organize itself at home as a class and that its own country is the immediate arena of its struggle \u2014 insofar as its class struggle is national, not in substance, but, as the Communist Manifesto says, \u2018in form\u2019.\r\nMarx, Critique of the Gotha Program (1875)", "Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\r\nMarx, Critique of the Gotha Program (1875)", "Every step of real movement is more important than a dozen programmes.\r\nMarx, Letter to Bracke (1875)", "The whole Darwinian theory of the struggle for existence is simply the transference from society to animate nature of Hobbes\u2019 theory of the war of every man against every man and the bourgeois economic theory of competition, along with the Malthusian theory of population. This feat having been accomplished \u2013 (as indicated under (1) I dispute its unqualified justification, especially where the Malthusian theory is concerned) \u2013 the same theories are next transferred back again from organic nature to history and their validity as eternal laws of human society declared to have been proved..\r\nMarx, Enegls to Lavrov (1875)", "Let us not, however, flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human victories over nature. For each such victory nature takes its revenge on us. Each victory, it is true, in the first place brings about the results we expected, but in the second and third places it has quite different, unforeseen effects which only too often cancel the first. The people who, in Mesopotamia, Greece, Asia Minor and elsewhere, destroyed the forests to obtain cultivable land, never dreamed that by removing along with the forests the collecting centres and reservoirs of moisture they were laying the basis for the present forlorn state of those countries. When the Italians of the Alps used up the pine forests on the southern slopes, so carefully cherished on the northern slopes, they had no inkling that by doing so they were cutting at the roots of the dairy industry in their region; they had still less inkling that they were thereby depriving their mountain springs of water for the greater part of the year, and making it possible for them to pour still more furious torrents on the plains during the rainy seasons. Those who spread the potato in Europe were not aware that with these farinaceous tubers they were at the same time spreading scrofula. Thus at every step we are reminded that we by no means rule over nature like a conqueror over a foreign people, like someone standing outside nature \u2013 but that we, with flesh, blood and brain, belong to nature, and exist in its midst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact\r\nthat we have the advantage over all other creatures of being able to learn its laws and apply them correctly.\r\nEngels, The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man (1876)", "Labour is the source of all wealth, the political economists assert. And it really is the source \u2014  next to nature, which supplies it with the material that it converts into wealth. But it is even infinitely more than this. It is the prime basic condition for all human existence, and this to such an extent that, in a sense, we have to say that labour created man himself.\r\nEngels, The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man (1876)", "When we consider and reflect upon nature at large or the history of mankind or our own intellectual activity, at first we see the picture of an endless entanglement of relations and reactions in which nothing remains what, where and as it was, but everything moves, changes, comes into being and passes away. This primitive, naive but intrinsically correct conception of the world is that of ancient Greek philosophy, and was first clearly formulated by Heraclitus: everything is and is not, for everything is fluid, is constantly changing, constantly coming into being and passing away.\u00a0\nBut this conception, correctly as it expresses the general character of the picture of appearances as a whole, does not suffice to explain the details of which this picture is made up, and so long as we do not understand these, we have not a clear idea of the whole picture. In order to understand these details we must detach them from their natural or historical connection and examine each one separately, its nature, special causes, effects, etc.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nOnly sound common sense, respectable fellow that he is, in the homely realm of his own four walls, has very wonderful adventures directly he ventures out into the wide world of research.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nNature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern science that it has furnished this proof with very rich materials increasing daily.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nall past history was the history of class struggles; that these warring classes of society are always the products of the modes of production and of exchange.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nthe principles are not the starting-point of the investigation, but its final result; they are not applied to nature and human history, but abstracted from them, it is not nature and the realm of man which conform to these principles, but the principles are only valid in so far as they are in conformity with nature and history. That is the only materialist conception of the matter.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nFreedom does not consist in any dreamt-of independence from natural laws, but in the knowledge of these laws, and in the possibility this gives of systematically making them work towards definite ends.\r\nEngels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)\n\u00a0\nThe idea that political acts, grand performances of state, are decisive in history is as old as written history itself, and is the main reason why so little material has been preserved for us in regard to the really progressive evolution of the peoples which has taken place quietly, in the background, behind these noisy scenes on the stage.\r\nEngels, The Theory of Force (1877)\n\u00a0\nNeither of us cares a straw for popularity. Let me cite one proof of this: such was my aversion to the personality cult that at the time of the International, when plagued by numerous moves \u2013 originating from various countries \u2013 to accord me public honour, I never allowed one of these to enter the domain of publicity, nor did I ever reply to them, save with an occasional snub.

In doing so, however, natural science enters the field of theory and here the methods of empiricism will not work, here only theoretical thinking can be of assistance.

This law, which has the same significance for history as the law of the transformation of energy has for natural science.\r\nEngels, Preface to The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1885)\n\u00a0\nThe economic facts, which have so far played no role or only a contemptible one in the writing of history, are, at least in the modern world, a decisive historical force; that they form the basis of the origination of the present-day class antagonisms; that these class antagonisms, in the countries where they have become fully developed, thanks to large-scale industry, hence especially in England, are in their turn the basis of the formation of political parties and of party struggles, and thus of all political history. Marx had not only arrived at the same view, but had already, in the Deutsche-Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher (1844), generalized it to the effect that, speaking generally, it is not the state which conditions and regulates the civil society at all, but civil society which conditions and regulates the state, and, consequently, that policy and its history are to be explained from the economic relations and their development, and not vice versa.\r\nEngels, On the History of the Communist League (1885)\n\u00a0\nCommunism now no longer meant the concoction, by means of the imagination, of an ideal society as perfect as possible, but insight into the nature, the conditions and the consequent general aims of the struggle waged by the proletariat.\r\nEngels, On the History of the Communist League (1885)\n\u00a0\nThe doctrine of Hegel, taken as a whole, left plenty of room for giving shelter to the most diverse practical party views. And in the theoretical Germany of that time, two things above all were practical: religion and politics. Whoever placed the chief emphasis on the Hegelian system could be fairly conservative in both spheres; whoever regarded the dialectical method as the main thing could belong to the most extreme opposition, both in politics and religion.\r\nEngels, Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy (1886)\n\u00a0\nThe great basic question of all philosophy, especially of more recent philosophy, is that concerning the relation of thinking and being. ... \r\nThe answers which the philosophers gave to this question split them into two great camps. Those who asserted the primacy of spirit to nature and, therefore, in the last instance, assumed world creation in some form or other \u2014 and among the philosophers, Hegel, for example, this creation often becomes still more intricate and impossible than in Christianity \u2014 comprised the camp of idealism. The others, who regarded nature as primary, belong to the various schools of materialism.\r\nEngels, Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy (1886)\n\u00a0\nThat which is willed happens but rarely; in the majority of instances the numerous desired ends cross and conflict with one another, or these ends themselves are from the outset incapable of realisation, or the means of attaining them are insufficient. thus the conflicts of innumerable individual wills and individual actions in the domain of history produce a state of affairs entirely analogous to that prevailing in the realm of unconscious nature.\r\nEngels, Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy (1886)\n\u00a0\nThe only war left for Prussia-Germany to wage will be a world war, a world war, moreover of an extent the violence hitherto unimagined. Eight to ten million soldiers will be at each other\u2019s throats and in the process they will strip Europe barer than a swarm of locusts. The depredations of the Years\u2019 War compressed into three to four years and extended over the entire continent; famine, disease, the universal lapse into barbarism.\r\nEngels, Introduction to Borkheim (1887)\n\u00a0\nAccording to the materialist conception of history, the ultimately determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life. Other than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted. Hence if somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the only determining one, he transforms that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase.\r\n[Engels, Letter to J Bloch (1890)\n\u00a0\nTo my mind, the so-called \u2018socialist society\u2019 is not anything immutable. Like all other social formations, it should be conceived in a state of constant flux and change. It\u2019s crucial difference from the present order consists naturally in production organized on the basis of common ownership by the nation of all means of production. To begin this reorganization tomorrow, but performing it gradually, seems to me quite feasible. That our workers are capable of it is borne out by their many producer and consumer cooperatives which, whenever they\u2019re not deliberately ruined by the police, are equally well and far more honestly run than the bourgeois stock companies.\r\nEngels, Letter to Otto Von Boenigk (1890)\n\u00a0\nThe day when we are in the majority, what the French army did instinctively in not firing on the people will be repeated in our country quite consciously. Yes, whatever the frightened bourgeois say, we are able to calculate the moment when we shall have the majority of the people behind us; our ideas are making headway everywhere, as much among teachers, doctors, lawyers, etc. as among the workers. If we had to start wielding power tomorrow, we should need engineers, chemists, agronomists. Well, it is my conviction that we would have a good many of them behind us already. In five or ten years we shall have more of them than we need.\r\nEngels, Interview with Le Figaro (1893)\n\u00a0\nAll science would be superfluous if the outward appearance and the essence of things directly coincided.\r\nMarx, published by Engels Capital, Volume III (1894)\n\u00a0\nJust as the savage must wrestle with Nature to satisfy his wants, to maintain and reproduce life, so must civilised man, and he must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of production. With his development this realm of physical necessity expands as a result of his wants; but, at the same time, the forces of production which satisfy these wants also increase. Freedom in this field can only consist in socialised man, the associated producers, rationally regulating their interchange with Nature, bringing it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by the blind forces of Nature; and achieving this with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favourable to, and worthy of, their human nature. But it nonetheless still remains a realm of necessity. Beyond it begins that development of human energy which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working-day is its basic prerequisite.\r\nMarx, published by Engels Capital, Volume III (1894)\n\u00a0\nWhat we understand by the economic conditions which we regard as the determining basis of the history of society are the methods by which human beings in a given society produce their means of subsistence and exchange the products among themselves (in so far as division of labour exists).

This law, which has the same significance for history as the law of the transformation of energy has for natural science.\r\nEngels, Preface to The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1885)", "The economic facts, which have so far played no role or only a contemptible one in the writing of history, are, at least in the modern world, a decisive historical force; that they form the basis of the origination of the present-day class antagonisms; that these class antagonisms, in the countries where they have become fully developed, thanks to large-scale industry, hence especially in England, are in their turn the basis of the formation of political parties and of party struggles, and thus of all political history. Marx had not only arrived at the same view, but had already, in the Deutsche-Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher (1844), generalized it to the effect that, speaking generally, it is not the state which conditions and regulates the civil society at all, but civil society which conditions and regulates the state, and, consequently, that policy and its history are to be explained from the economic relations and their development, and not vice versa.\r\nEngels, On the History of the Communist League (1885)", "Communism now no longer meant the concoction, by means of the imagination, of an ideal society as perfect as possible, but insight into the nature, the conditions and the consequent general aims of the struggle waged by the proletariat.\r\nEngels, On the History of the Communist League (1885)", "The doctrine of Hegel, taken as a whole, left plenty of room for giving shelter to the most diverse practical party views. And in the theoretical Germany of that time, two things above all were practical: religion and politics. Whoever placed the chief emphasis on the Hegelian system could be fairly conservative in both spheres; whoever regarded the dialectical method as the main thing could belong to the most extreme opposition, both in politics and religion.\r\nEngels, Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy (1886)", "The great basic question of all philosophy, especially of more recent philosophy, is that concerning the relation of thinking and being. ... \r\nThe answers which the philosophers gave to this question split them into two great camps. Those who asserted the primacy of spirit to nature and, therefore, in the last instance, assumed world creation in some form or other \u2014 and among the philosophers, Hegel, for example, this creation often becomes still more intricate and impossible than in Christianity \u2014 comprised the camp of idealism. The others, who regarded nature as primary, belong to the various schools of materialism.\r\nEngels, Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy (1886)", "That which is willed happens but rarely; in the majority of instances the numerous desired ends cross and conflict with one another, or these ends themselves are from the outset incapable of realisation, or the means of attaining them are insufficient. thus the conflicts of innumerable individual wills and individual actions in the domain of history produce a state of affairs entirely analogous to that prevailing in the realm of unconscious nature.\r\nEngels, Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy (1886)", "The only war left for Prussia-Germany to wage will be a world war, a world war, moreover of an extent the violence hitherto unimagined. Eight to ten million soldiers will be at each other\u2019s throats and in the process they will strip Europe barer than a swarm of locusts. The depredations of the Years\u2019 War compressed into three to four years and extended over the entire continent; famine, disease, the universal lapse into barbarism.\r\nEngels, Introduction to Borkheim (1887)", "According to the materialist conception of history, the ultimately determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life. Other than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted. Hence if somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the only determining one, he transforms that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase.\r\n[Engels, Letter to J Bloch (1890)", "To my mind, the so-called \u2018socialist society\u2019 is not anything immutable. Like all other social formations, it should be conceived in a state of constant flux and change. It\u2019s crucial difference from the present order consists naturally in production organized on the basis of common ownership by the nation of all means of production. To begin this reorganization tomorrow, but performing it gradually, seems to me quite feasible. That our workers are capable of it is borne out by their many producer and consumer cooperatives which, whenever they\u2019re not deliberately ruined by the police, are equally well and far more honestly run than the bourgeois stock companies.\r\nEngels, Letter to Otto Von Boenigk (1890)", "The day when we are in the majority, what the French army did instinctively in not firing on the people will be repeated in our country quite consciously. Yes, whatever the frightened bourgeois say, we are able to calculate the moment when we shall have the majority of the people behind us; our ideas are making headway everywhere, as much among teachers, doctors, lawyers, etc. as among the workers. If we had to start wielding power tomorrow, we should need engineers, chemists, agronomists. Well, it is my conviction that we would have a good many of them behind us already. In five or ten years we shall have more of them than we need.\r\nEngels, Interview with Le Figaro (1893)", "All science would be superfluous if the outward appearance and the essence of things directly coincided.\r\nMarx, published by Engels Capital, Volume III (1894)", "Just as the savage must wrestle with Nature to satisfy his wants, to maintain and reproduce life, so must civilised man, and he must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of production. With his development this realm of physical necessity expands as a result of his wants; but, at the same time, the forces of production which satisfy these wants also increase. Freedom in this field can only consist in socialised man, the associated producers, rationally regulating their interchange with Nature, bringing it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by the blind forces of Nature; and achieving this with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favourable to, and worthy of, their human nature. But it nonetheless still remains a realm of necessity. Beyond it begins that development of human energy which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working-day is its basic prerequisite.\r\nMarx, published by Engels Capital, Volume III (1894)", "What we understand by the economic conditions which we regard as the determining basis of the history of society are the methods by which human beings in a given society produce their means of subsistence and exchange the products among themselves (in so far as division of labour exists). Thus the entire technique of production and transport is here included. According to our conception, this technique also determines the method of exchange and, further, the division of products, ...\r\nEngels, Letter to Starkenburg (1894)", "Private property has made us so stupid and one-sided that an object is only ours when we have it \u2013 when it exists for us as capital, or when it is directly possessed, eaten, drunk, worn, inhabited, etc., \u2013 in short, when it is used by us. Although private property itself again conceives all these direct realisations of possession only as means of life, and the life which they serve as means is the life of private property \u2013 labour and conversion into capital.Karl Marx, Private Property and Communism (1844)", "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it. Karl Marx, Theses On Feuerbach (1845)", "As individuals express their life, so they are. What they are, therefore, coincides with their production, both with what they produce and with how they produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.Karl Marx, The German Ideology (1845)", "Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness, and for the success of the cause itself, the alteration of men on a mass scale is, necessary, an alteration which can only take place in a practical movement, a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew.Karl Marx, The German Ideology (1845)", "The slave frees himself when, of all the relations of private property, he abolishes only the relation of slavery and thereby becomes a proletarian; the proletarian can free himself only by abolishing private property in general.Frederick Engels, The Principles of Communism (1847)", "What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848)", "We by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of others. All that we want to do away with is the miserable character of this appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it.Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848)", "The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general.

Are we to sit back and abstain while somebody tries to rob us of them? It is said that a political act on our part implies that we accept the exiting state of affairs. On the contrary, so long as this state of affairs offers us the means of protesting against it, our use of these means does not signify that we recognise the prevailing order.Frederick Engels, Apropos Of Working-Class Political Action (1871)", "Every step of real movement is more important than a dozen programmes.Karl Marx, Letter to Bracke (In Brunswick) (1875)", "Labour is the source of all wealth, the political economists assert. And it really is the source \u00d0 next to nature, which supplies it with the material that it converts into wealth. But it is even infinitely more than this. It is the prime basic condition for all human existence, and this to such an extent that, in a sense, we have to say that labour created man himself.Frederick Engels, The Part played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man (1876)", "We...reject every attempt to impose on us any moral dogma whatsoever as an eternal, ultimate and forever immutable ethical law on the pretext that the moral world, too, has its permanent principles which stand above history and the differences between nations. We maintain on the contrary that all moral theories have been hitherto the product, in the last analysis, of the economic conditions of society obtaining at the time. And as society has hitherto moved in class antagonisms, morality has always been class morality; it has either justified the domination and the interests of the ruling class, or ever since the oppressed class became powerful enough, it has represented its indignation against this domination and the future interests of the oppressed. That in this process there has on the whole been progress in morality, as in all other branches of human knowledge, no one will doubt. But we have not yet passed beyond class morality.Frederick Engels, Anti-D\u00fchring (1877)", "The proletariat seizes the public power, and by means of this transforms the socialized means of production, slipping from the hands of the bourgeoisie, into public property. By this act, the proletariat frees the means of production from the character of capital they have thus far borne, and gives their socialized character complete freedom to work itself out. Socialized production upon a predetermined plan becomes henceforth possible. The development of production makes the existence of different classes of society thenceforth an anachronism. In proportion as anarchy in social production vanishes, the political authority of the State dies out. Man, at last the master of his own form of social organization, becomes at the same time the lord over Nature, his own master \u2013 free.To accomplish this act of universal emancipation is the historical mission of the modern proletariat. To thoroughly comprehend the historical conditions and this the very nature of this act, to impart to the now oppressed proletarian class a full knowledge of the conditions and of the meaning of the momentous act it is called upon to accomplish, this is the task of the theoretical expression of the proletarian movement, scientific Socialism.Frederick Engels, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (1880)", "The revolutionary power which will socialise the instruments of labour taken from the capitalist class, will have to mount guard over the general interests of society served by the socialised industries, and in particular over the interests of those directly engaged in them.Paul Lafargue, Socialism and Nationalisation (1882)", "All science would be superfluous if the outward appearance and the essence of things directly coincided.Karl Marx,  Capital Vol. III Chapter 48  (1883) ", "We must not be like some Christians who sin for six days and go to church on the seventh, but we must speak for the cause daily, and make the men, and especially the women that we meet, come into the ranks to help us.Eleanor Marx, Speech on the First May Day (1890)", "The division of society into a small, excessively rich class and a large, propertyless class of wage-workers results in a society suffocating from its own superfluity, while the great majority of its members is scarcely, or even not at all, protected from extreme want.

It must be abolished, it can be abolished.Frederick Engels, Introduction to Marx\u2019s Wage Labor and Capital (1891)", "Only when the great mass of workers take the keen and dependable weapons of scientific socialism in their own hands, will all the petty-bourgeois inclinations, all the opportunistic currents, come to naught.

We are surrounded on all sides by enemies, and we have to advance almost constantly under their fire. We have combined, by a freely adopted decision, for the purpose of fighting the enemy, and not of retreating into the neighbouring marsh, the inhabitants of which, from the very outset, have reproached us with having separated ourselves into an exclusive group and with having chosen the path of struggle instead of the path of conciliation. And now some among us begin to cry out: Let us go into the marsh! And when we begin to shame them, they retort: What backward people you are! Are you not ashamed to deny us the liberty to invite you to take a better road! Oh, yes, gentlemen! You are free not only to invite us, but to go yourselves wherever you will, even into the marsh. In fact, we think that the marsh is your proper place, and we are prepared to render you every assistance to get there. Only let go of our hands, don\u2019t clutch at us and don\u2019t besmirch the grand word freedom, for we too are \u2018free\u00d3 to go where we please, free to fight not only against the marsh, but also against those who are turning towards the marsh!VI Lenin,  What Is To Be Done? (1901)", "If, contrary to all the efforts of our enemies, the modern labor movement marches triumphantly forward, its head raised high, then it owes this first and foremost to its calm understanding of the lawfulness of objective historical development, its understanding that \u201ccapitalist society with the inevitability of a natural process creates its own negation, namely, the expropriation of the expropriators, the socialist overturn.\u201d In this, its understanding, the labor movement sees a reliable guarantee of its final victory. And from this same source it draws not only its ability to surge forward but also its patience ; not only strength for action, but also the courage to stand firm and to endure.Rosa Luxemburg, Marxist Theory and the Proletariat (1903)", "War unleashes \u2013 at the same time as the reactionary forces of the capitalist world \u2013 the generating forces of social revolution which ferment in its depths.Rosa Luxemburg, In the Storm (1904)", "From the moment when the priests use the pulpit as a means of political struggle against the working classes, the workers must fight against the enemies of their rights and their liberation. For he who defends the exploiters and who helps to prolong this present regime of misery, he is the mortal enemy of the proletariat...Rosa Luxemburg, Socialism and the Churches (1905)", "Religion is one of the forms of spiritual oppression which everywhere weighs down heavily upon the masses of the people, over burdened by their perpetual work for others, by want and isolation. Impotence of the exploited classes in their struggle against the exploiters just as inevitably gives rise to the belief in a better life after death as impotence of the savage in his battle with nature gives rise to belief in gods, devils, miracles, and the like. Those who toil and live in want all their lives are taught by religion to be submissive and patient while here on earth, and to take comfort in the hope of a heavenly reward. But those who live by the labour of others are taught by religion to practise charity while on earth, thus offering them a very cheap way of justifying their entire existence as exploiters and selling them at a moderate price tickets to well-being in heaven. Religion is opium for the people. Religion is a sort of spiritual booze, in which the slaves of capital drown their human image, their demand for a life more or less worthy of man.VI Lenin, Socialsm and Religion (1905)", "And it is not our object to destroy civilization. We do not desire to \u201cdivide up,\u201d as people are in the habit of saying; we do not wish to throw humanity back into barbarism; on the contrary, we desire to lift the whole of humanity to the highest thinkable plane of civilization. We wish every individual without exception to have a share in the means of culture and education according to his capacities and his needs. This is the loftiest ideal that the human race can set before itself; and this ideal is possible today because it is only now that, in consequence of the thousands of years of progress towards civilization and of the tremendous acquisitions which man has gained in this age of culture; because only now are all the means and possibilities given through which we may realize this ideal condition in the way that the majority of men desire to realize it.August Bebel, Socialism and the Student (1905)", "Whatever is done we must do ourselves, and if we stand up like men from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from Canada to the Gulf, we will strike terror to their cowardly hearts and they will be but too eager to relax their grip upon our throats and beat a swift retreat.Eugene V.

Everyone knows that the reason is by no means because the factory owners wish to feed the hungry workers, but because they wish to extract profit from them. For the sake of profit, the factory owner builds his factory; for the sake of profit, he engages workers; for the sake of profit, he is always nosing out where higher prices are paid. Profit is the motive of all his calculations. Herein, moreover, we discern a very interesting characteristic of capitalist society. For society does not itself produce the things which are necessary and useful to it; instead of this, the capitalist class compels the workers to produce those things for which more will be paid, those things from which the capitalists derive the largest profit. Whisky, for example, is a very harmful substance, and alcoholic liquors in general ought to be produced; only for technical purposes and for their use in medicine. But throughout the world the capitalists produce alcohol with all their might. Why? Because to ply the people with drink is extremely profitable.N.I. Bukharin and E.

Start from perceptual knowledge and actively develop it into rational knowledge; then start from rational knowledge and actively guide revolutionary practice to change both the subjective and the objective world. Practice, knowledge, again practice, and again knowledge. This form repeats itself in endless cycles, and with each cycle the content of practice and knowledge rises to a higher level.

We should not look upon ourselves as immutable, perfect and sacrosanct, as persons who need not and cannot be changed. When we pose the task of remoulding ourselves in social struggle, we are not demeaning ourselves; the objective laws of social development demand it. Unless we do so, we cannot make progress, or fulfill the task of changing society.Liu Shaoqi, How to be a Good Communist (1939)", "Never become alienated from the masses; learn from them and help them.

It seeks profits and still more profits.The bourgeois class itself is divided into several strata, and each of those into several groups. In their pursuit of profits, the capitalists not only unscrupulously exploit the proletariat; even within their own class the capitalists do not scruple to swallow up their rivals in competition \u2013 the big fish swallows the little fish, the big bourgeoisie swallows the petty and middle bourgeoisie, one group squeezes out and swallows another group.The bourgeoisie strives to possess the means of production and the market of its own country. And since its greed for profits knows no limits, the bourgeoisie strives to expand beyond its own country, to seize foreign markets, sources of raw materials and areas for capital investment, thus subjugating other nations and exploiting them. At the same time it squeezes out the bourgeoisie or rival capitalists of other countries.The exploitation of wage labour, competition, the squeezing out, suppressing and swallowing of rivals among the capitalists themselves, the resorting to war and even world war, the utilization of all means to secure a monopoly position in its own country and throughout the world \u2013 such is the inherent character of the profit-seeking bourgeoisie. This is the class basis of bourgeois nationalism and of all bourgeois ideologies.Liu Shaoqi, Internationalism and Nationalism (1952) ", "We stand firmly for peace and against war.

He interprets history, understands its dynamic, predicts the future, but in addition to predicting it (which would satisfy his scientific obligation), he expresses a revolutionary concept: the world must not only be interpreted, it must be transformed.

It\u2019s not communism that set alight class struggle. But it\u2019s capitalism that destroys the property of the little people in order to take it over; that buys at a low price the labor of the worker and makes weigh upon him the full weight of oppression and coercion. War, economic crisis, unemployment, the expropriation and ruin of the middle classes are not our doing. They are the result of the private property of the great means of production, which has become \u2013 after having been a stimulant \u2013 a hindrance to economic life and progress.

It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality. Perhaps it is one of the great dramas of the leader that he or she must combine a passionate spirit with a cold intelligence and make painful decisions without flinching. Our vanguard revolutionaries must idealize this love of the people, of the most sacred causes, and make it one and indivisible. They cannot descend, with small doses of daily affection, to the level where ordinary people put their love into practice. Che Guevara, Socialism and Man in Cuba (1965)", "Socialism is not spontaneous. It does not arise of itself.

It can be eradicated by exposing religion, ethnicism, racism and any reactionary ideology, which has no respect for people. Our response is to fight for the creation of an open, free and equal society in which people, their lives, dignity and well being are valued.Mansoor Hekmat, Ending Terrorism is Our Task (2001)", "Only for its own purposes did the strike allow itself to break the vow of immobility. When it needed news bulletins of the revolution it opened a printing works; it used the telegraph to send out strike instructions; it let trains carrying strikers\u2019 delegates pass.\nNothing else was exempt: the strike closed down industrial plants, chemists\u2019 and grocers\u2019 shops, courts of law, everything.\nFrom time to time its attention wearied and its vigilance slackened, now here, now there. Sometimes a reckless train would break through the strike barrier: then the strike would set off in pursuit of it. The guilty train, like a criminal on the run, raced through dark and empty stations, unannounced by the telegraph, leaving a wake of fear and uncertainty behind it. But in the end the strike would catch up with the train, stop the engine, immobilize the driver, let off the steam.\nIt used every possible means. It appealed, convinced, implored; it begged on its knees\u2014that is what a woman orator did at the Kursky Station in Moscow\u2014it threatened, terrorized, threw stones, finally fired off its Brownings. It wanted to achieve its aim at whatever cost. It staked too much: the blood of fathers, the bread of children, the reputation of its own strength. An entire class obeyed it; and when a negligible fraction of that class, corrupted by the very forces it was fighting, stood in its path, it is scarcely surprising that the strike roughly kicked the obstacle aside.\nChapter 7 of 1905 (1907)", "As a general rule, the party does not make a decision on every isolated strike. It helps le trade union to decide the question of knowing if the strike is opportune, by means of its political and economic information and by its advice. It serves the strike with its agitation, etc. First place in the strike belongs, of course to the trade union.\nCommunism and Syndicalism (1931)", "In the trade unions, the Communists, of course, submit to the discipline of the party, no matter what posts they occupy. This does not exclude but presupposes their submission to trade union discipline. In other words, the party does not impose upon them any line of conduct that contradicts the state of mind or the opinions of the majority of the members of trade unions.\nCommunism and Syndicalism (1931)", "In capitalist countries, where the Communist Party does not possess any means of coercion, it is obvious that it can give leadership only by Communists being in the trade unions as rank-and-file members or functionaries.\nCommunism and Syndicalism (1931)", "The general strike is only a mobilization of the proletariat and its setting up against its enemy, the State; but that the strike in itself cannot produce the solution of the problem, because it exhausts the forces of the proletariat sooner than those of its enemies, and this, sooner or later, forces the workers to return to the factories. The general strike acquires a decisive importance only as a preliminary to a conflict between the proletariat and the armed forces of the opposition \u2013 i.e., to the open revolutionary rising of the workers. Only by breaking the will of the armies thrown against it can the revolutionary class solve the problem of power \u2013 the root problem of every revolution. The general strike produces the mobilization of both sides, and gives the first serious estimate of the powers of resistance of the counterrevolution.\nTerrorism and Communism (1920)", "Bureaucratism is not a fortuitous feature of certain provincial organizations, but a general phenomenon. It does not travel from the district to the central organization through the medium of the regional organization, but much rather from the central organization to the district through the medium of the regional organization. It is not at all a survival of the war period; it is the result of the transference to the party of the methods and the administrative manners accumulated during these last years.\nThe New Course (1923)", "In playing the role of party leader and being absorbed by the questions of administration, the old generation accustomed itself to think and to decide, as it still does, for the party. For the communist masses, it brings to the forefront purely bookish, pedagogical methods of participating in political life: elementary political training courses, examinations of the knowledge of its members, party schools, etc. Thence the bureaucratism of the apparatus, its cliquism, its exclusive internal life, in a word, all the traits that constitute the profoundly negative  side of the old course.\nThe New Course (1923)", "Those comrades who assert most flatly, with the greatest insistence and sometimes most brutally, that every difference of opinion, every grouping of opinion, however temporary, is an expression of the interests of classes opposed to the proletariat, do not want to apply this criterion to bureaucratism.\nThe New Course (1923)", "Mechanical centralism is necessarily complemented by factionalism, which is at once a malicious caricature of democracy and a potential political danger.\n Letter to Party Meetings (1923)", "The Soviet bureaucracy is like all ruling classes in that it is ready to shut its eyes to the crudest mistakes of its leaders in the sphere of general politics, provided in return they show an unconditional fidelity in the defense of its privileges.\nRevolution Betrayed (1936)", "If the leaders seek only to preserve themselves, that is what they become; preserves, dried preserves.\nSome Questions on American Problems (1940)", "The Soviet Union emerged from the October Revolution as a workers state. State ownership of the means of production, a necessary prerequisite to socialist development, opened up the possibility of rapid growth of the productive forces. But the apparatus of the workers\u2019 state underwent a complete degeneration at the same time: it was transformed from a weapon of the working class into a weapon of bureaucratic violence against the working class and more and more a weapon for the sabotage of the country\u2019s economy. The bureaucratization of a backward and isolated workers\u2019 state and the transformation of the bureaucracy into an all-powerful privileged caste constitute the most convincing refutation \u2013 not only theoretically, but this time, practically \u2013 of the theory of socialism in one country.\nThe USSR and Problems of the Transitional Epoch (1938)", "The goal to be attained by the overthrow of the bureaucracy is the reestablishment of the rule of the Soviets, expelling from them the present bureaucracy. It is the task of the regenerated Soviets to collaborate with the world revolution and the building of a socialist society. The overthrow of the bureaucracy therefore presupposes the preservation of state property and of planned economy.\nThe USSR and War (1939)", "One has to put a wadded nightcap not only over one\u2019s eyes, but over one\u2019s nose and ears, to be able to-day, after the inglorious collapse of the Second International, after the disgraceful bankruptcy of its leading party, after the bloody lunacy of the world slaughter and the gigantic sweep of the civil war, to set up in contrast to us, the profundity, the loyalty, the peacefulness and the sobriety of the Second International, the heritage of which we are still liquidating.\nTerrorism and Communism (1920)", "It is untrue that revolutionary art can be created only by workers. Just because the revolution is a working-class revolution, it releases \u2013 to repeat what was said before \u2013 very little working-class energy for art.\nCommunist Policy Toward Art (1923)", "Art must make its own way and by its own means. The Marxian methods are not the same as the artistic. The party leads the proletariat but not the \nhistoric processes of history.\nCommunist Policy Toward Art (1923)", "Such terms as \u201cproletarian literature\u201d and \u201cproletarian culture\u201d are dangerous, because they erroneously compress the Culture of the future into the narrow limits of the present day. They falsify perspectives, they violate proportions, they distort standards and they cultivate the arrogance of small circles which is most dangerous.\nLiterature and Revolution (1924)", "The ancient philosopher said that strife is the father of all things. No new values can be created where a free conflict of ideas is impossible. To be sure, a revolutionary dictatorship means by its very essence strict limitations of freedom. But for that very reason epochs of revolution have never been directly favorable to cultural creation: they have only cleared the arena for it. The dictatorship of the proletariat opens a wider scope to human genius the more it ceases to be a dictatorship. The socialist culture will flourish only in proportion to the dying away of the state. \nRevolution Betrayed (1936)", "Generally speaking, art is an expression of man\u2019s need for an harmonious and complete life, that is to say, his need for those major benefits of which a society of classes has deprived him. That is why a protest against reality, either conscious or unconscious, active or passive, optimistic or pessimistic, always forms part of a really creative piece of work. Every new tendency in art has begun with rebellion.\nArt and Politics in Our Epoch (1938)", "The essence of Marxism consists in this, that it approaches society concretely, as a subject for objective research, and analyzes human history as one would a colossal laboratory record. Marxism appraises ideology as a subordinate integral element of the material social structure. Marxism examines the class structure of society as a historically conditioned form of the development of the productive forces; Marxism deduces from the productive forces of society the inter-relations between human society and surrounding nature, and these, in turn are determined at each historical stage by man\u2019s technology, his instruments and weapons, his capacities and methods for struggle with nature. Precisely this objective approach arms Marxism with the insuperable power of historical foresight.\nDialectical Materialism and Science (1925)", "If it is possible to place a given person\u2019s general type of thought on the basis of his relation to concrete practical problems, it is also possible to predict approximately, knowing his general type of thought, how a given individual will approach one or another practical question. That is the incomparable educational value of the dialectical method of thought.\nA Petty-Bourgeois Opposition in the Socialist Workers Party (1939)", "Dialectical thinking is related to vulgar in the same way that a motion picture is related to a still photograph. The motion picture does not outlaw the still photograph but combines a series of them according to the laws of motion. Dialectics does not deny the syllogism, but teaches us to combine syllogisms in such a way as to bring our understanding closer to the eternally changing reality. \nThe ABC of Materialist Dialectics (1939)", "The dialectic is not a magic master key for all questions. It does not replace concrete scientific analysis. But it directs this analysis along the correct road, securing it against sterile wanderings in the desert of subjectivism and scholasticism. \nThe ABC of Materialist Dialectics (1939)", "The democratic regime is the most aristocratic way of ruling. It is possible only to a rich nation.\nDiscussions on the Transitional Program (1938)", "We must give a scientific explanation of society, and clearly explain it to the masses. That is the difference between Marxism and reformism.\nDiscussions on the Transitional Program (1938)", "Such categories as \u2018commodity\u2019, \u2018money\u2019, \u2018wages\u2019, \u2018capital\u2019, \u2018profit\u2019, \u2018tax\u2019, and the like are only semi-mystical reflections in men\u2019s heads of the various aspects of a process of economy which they do not understand and which is not under their control. To decipher them, a thoroughgoing scientific analysis is indispensable.\nMarxism in Our Time (1939)", "It was not Marx\u2019s aim to discover the \u2018eternal laws\u2019 of economy. He denied the existence of such laws. The history of the development of human society is the history of the succession of various systems of economy, each operating in accordance with its own laws. ... In his Capital, Marx does not study economy in general, but capitalist economy, which has its own specific laws. Only in passing does he refer to the other economic systems to elucidate the characteristics of capitalism.\nMarxism in Our Time (1939)", "Just as the operation of the laws of physiology yields different results in a growing than in a dying organism, so the laws of Marxist economy assert themselves differently in a developing and disintegrating capitalism.\nMarxism in Our Time (1939)", "Problems of Everyday Life\nOur Soviet bureaucratic machine is unique, complex, containing as it does the traditions of different epochs together with the germs of future relationships. With us, civility, as a general rule, does not exist. But of rudeness, inherited from the past, we have as much as you please.\nCivility and Politeness as a Necessary Lubricant in Daily Relations (1923)\n\u00a0\nThere are two big facts which have set a new stamp on working class life. The one is the advent of the eight-hour working day; the other, the prohibition of the sale of vodka.\nVodka, the Church and the Cinema (1923)\n\u00a0\nThe workers\u2019 state must become wealthier in order that it may be possible seriously to tackle the public education of children and the releasing of the family from the burden of the kitchen and the laundry. Socialization of family housekeeping and public education of children are unthinkable without a marked improvement in our economics as a whole. We need more socialist economic forms. Only under such conditions can we free the family from the functions and cares that now oppress and disintegrate it. Washing must be done by a public laundry, catering by a public restaurant, sewing by a public workshop. Children must be educated by good public teachers who have a real vocation for the work. Then the bond between husband and wife would be freed from everything external and accidental, and the one would cease to absorb the life of the other. Genuine equality would at last be established.\nVodka, the Church and the Cinema (1923)\n\u00a0\nA certain advance towards the new family is possible even now. It is true that the state cannot as yet undertake either the education of children or the establishment of public kitchens that would be an improvement on the family kitchen, or the establishment of public laundries where the clothes would not be torn or stolen. But this does not mean that the more enterprising and progressive families cannot group themselves even now into collective house keeping units. Experiments of this kind must, of course, be made carefully.\nVodka, the Church and the Cinema (1923)\n\u00a0\nThe proletariat has made a big stride, but more in politics than in life and morals. Life is conservative. In its primitive aspect, of course, Rasteryaev Street [referring to a book by Uspensky] no longer exists. The brutal treatment accorded to apprentices, the servility practiced before employers, the vicious drunkenness, and the street hooliganism have vanished. But in the relations of husband and wife, parents and children, in the domestic life of the family, fenced off from the whole world, Rasteryaevism is still firmly implanted. We need years and decades of economic growth and culture to banish Rasteryaevism from its last refuge \u2013 individual and family life \u2013 recreating it from top to bottom in the spirit of collectivism.\nHabit and Custom (1923)\n\u00a0\nAbusive language and swearing are a legacy of slavery, humiliation, and disrespect for human dignity, one\u2019s own and that of other people.\nThe Struggle for Cultured Speech (1923)\n\u00a0\nThe husband, torn away from his usual surroundings by mobilization, changed into a revolutionary citizen at the civic front. A momentous change. His outlook is wider, his spiritual aspirations higher and of a more complicated order. He is a different man. And then he returns to find everything there practically unchanged. The old harmony and understanding with the people at home in family relationship is gone. No new understanding arises. The mutual wondering changes into mutual discontent, then into ill will. The family is broken up.\nFrom the Old Family to the New (1923)\n\u00a0\nThe workers state has rejected church ceremony, and informed its citizens that they have the right to be born, to marry, and to die without the mysterious gestures and exhortations of persons clad in cassocks, gowns, and other ecclesiastical vestments. But custom finds it harder to discard ceremony than the state.\nThe Family and Ceremony (1923)\n\u00a0\nThe dictatorship will have to become softer and milder as the economic welfare of the country is raised. The present method of commanding human beings will give way to one of disposing over things. The road leads not to the robot but to man of a higher order.\nFamily Relations Under the Soviets (1932)\n\u00a0\nThese gentlemen have, it seems, completely forgotten that socialism was to remove the cause which impels woman to abortion, and not force her into the \u201cjoys of motherhood.\u201d with the help of a foul police interference in what is to every woman the most intimate sphere of life.\nThermidor in the Family\u2014from Revolution Betrayed (1936)\n\u00a0\nThe place of the family as a shut-in petty enterprise was to be occupied, according to plans, by a finished system of social care and accommodation: maternity houses, creches, kindergartens, school and hospitals, sanatoria, athletic organisations, film theatres, etc. The complete absorption of the housekeeping functions of the family by institutions of the socialist society, uniting all generations in solidarity and mutual aid, was to bring women, and thereby to the loving couple, a real liberation from the thousand-year-old fetters.\nTrotsky, Thermidor in the Family\u2014from Revolution Betrayed (1936)\n\u00a0\nOn Revolution\nJust as a blacksmith cannot seize the red hot iron in his naked hand, so the proletariat cannot directly seize the power; it has to have an organisation accommodated to this task. The co-ordination of the mass insurrection with the conspiracy, the subordination of the conspiracy to the insurrection, the organisation of the insurrection through the conspiracy, constitutes that complex and responsible department of revolutionary politics which Marx and Engels called \u201cthe art of insurrection.\u201d It presupposes a correct general leadership of the masses, a flexible orientation in changing conditions, a thought-out plan of attack, cautiousness in technical preparation, and a daring blow.\nHistory of the Russian Revolution, Chpter 30 (1930)\n\u00a0\nEclectics live by means of episodic thoughts and improvisations that originate under the impact of events. Marxist cadres capable of leading the proletarian revolution are trained only by the continual and successive working out of problems and disputes.\nWhat Next for the German Revolution? (1932)\n\u00a0\nA revolution is \u201cmade\u201d directly by a minority.\nHue and Cry Over Kronstadt (1938)\n\u00a0\nNothing is more dangerous in politics, especially in a critical period, than to repeat general formulas without examining their social content.\nWhither France? (1934)\n\u00a0\n \u201cGuerrillaism\u201d was the military expression of the peasant background of the revolution.\nPreface to the Military Writings (1923)\n\u00a0\nArguments to the effect that all violence, including revolutionary violence, is evil and that Communists therefore ought not to engage in \u201cglorification\u201d of armed struggle and the revolutionary army, amount to a philosophy worthy of Quakers and the old maids of the Salvation Army. Permitting such propaganda in a Communist Party is like permitting Tolstoyan propaganda in the garrison of a besieged fortress.\nIntroduction to the Military Writings (1923)\n\u00a0\nOn Permanent Revolution\nWith regard to countries with a belated bourgeois development, especially the colonial and semi-colonial countries, the theory of the permanent revolution signifies that the complete and genuine solution of their tasks of achieving democracy and national emancipation is conceivable only through the dictatorship of the proletariat as the leader of the subjugated nation, above all of its peasant masses.\nTheory of Permanent Revolution (1931)\n\u00a0\nThe dictatorship of the proletariat which has risen to power as the leader of the democratic revolution is inevitably and, very quickly confronted with tasks, the fulfillment of which is bound up with deep inroads into the rights of bourgeois property. The democratic revolution grows over directly into the socialist revolution and thereby becomes a permanent revolution.\nTheory of Permanent Revolution (1931)\n\u00a0\nThe utopian hopes of the epoch of military communism came in later for a cruel, and in many respects just, criticism. The theoretical mistake of the ruling party remains inexplicable, however, only if you leave out of account the fact that all calculations at that time were based on the hope of an early victory of the revolution in the West.\nRevolution Betrayed (1936)\n\u00a0\nThe completion of the socialist revolution within national limits is unthinkable.\nTheory of Permanent Revolution (1931)\n\u00a0\nOn the United Front and the Fight Against Fascism\nTo say to the Social Democratic workers: \u201cCast your leaders aside and join our \u2018non-party\u2019 united front\u201d means to add just one more hollow phrase to a thousand others. We must understand how to tear the workers away from their leaders in reality. But reality today is the struggle against fascism. ... The overwhelming majority of the Social Democratic workers will fight against the fascists, but \u2013 for the present at least \u2013 only together with their organizations. This stage cannot be skipped. \nFor a Workers\u2019 United Front Against Fascism (1931)\n\u00a0\nWhen a state turns fascist, it doesn\u2019t only mean that the forms and methods of government are changed in accordance with the patterns set by Mussolini \u2013 the changes in this sphere ultimately play a minor role \u2013 but it means, primarily and above all, that the workers\u2019 organizations are annihilated;  that the proletariat is reduced to an amorphous state; and that a system of \nadministration is created which penetrates deeply into the masses and which serves to frustrate the independent crystallization of the proletariat.  Therein precisely is the gist of fascism.\nWhat Next for the German Revolution? (1932)\n\u00a0\nThe progress of a class toward class consciousness, that is, the building of a revolutionary party which leads the proletariat, is a complex and a contradictory process. The class itself is not homogeneous. Its different sections arrive at class consciousness by different paths and at different times. The bourgeoisie participates actively in this process. Within the working class, it creates its own institutions, or utilizes those already existing, in order to oppose certain strata of workers to others. Within the proletariat several parties are active at the same time. Therefore, for the greater part of its historical journey, it remains split politically. The problem of the united front \u2013 which arises during certain periods most sharply originates therein. The historical interests of the proletariat find their expression in the Communist Party \u2013 when its policies are correct. The task of the Communist Party consists in winning over the majority of the proletariat; and only thus is the socialist revolution made possible. The Communist Party cannot fulfill its mission except by preserving, completely and unconditionally, its political and organizational independence apart from all other parties and organizations within and without the working class.\nBureaucratic Ultimatism (1932)\n\u00a0\nUltimatism is an attempt to rape the working class after failing to convince it.\nBureaucratic Ultimatism (1932)\n\u00a0\nThe stubborn, doltish, and insensate rejection by the Communist Party of the policies of the united front provides the Social Democracy, under the present conditions, with its most important political weapon. \nBureaucratic Ultimatism (1932)\n\u00a0\nAll talk to the effect that we should accept a united front with the masses but not with the leaders is sheer scholasticism. This is like saying that we agree to conduct strikes against the capitalists but refuse to enter into negotiations with them. It is impossible to lead strike struggles without entering at a certain moment into negotiations with the capitalists or their plenipotentiaries. It is just as impossible to summon the organized masses to a united struggle without entering into negotiations with those whom a particular section of the mass has made its plenipotentiaries. \nFirst Five Years of the Communist International (1924)\n\u00a0\nThe Fascists find their human material mainly in the petty bourgeoisie. The latter has been entirely ruined by big capital. There is no way out for it in the present social order, but it knows of no other.  \nWhither France? (1934)\n\u00a0\nThe situation is revolutionary, as revolutionary as it can be, granted the non-revolutionary policies of the working-class parties. More exactly, the situation is pre-revolutionary. In order to bring the situation to its full maturity, there must be an immediate, vigorous, unremitting mobilization of the masses, under the slogan of the conquest of power in the name of socialism. This is the only way through which the pre-revolutionary situation will be changed into a revolutionary situation.  \nWhither France? (1934)\n\u00a0\nContemporary society is composed of three classes: the big bourgeoisie, the proletariat and the \u2018middle classes\u2019, or the petty bourgeoisie. The relations among these three classes determine in the final analysis the political situation in the country. The fundamental classes of society are the big bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Only these two classes can have a clear, consistent, independent policy of their own. The petty bourgeoisie is distinguished by its economic dependence and its social heterogeneity. Its upper stratum is linked directly to the big bourgeoisie. Its lower stratum merges with the proletariat and even falls to the status of lumpen proletariat. In accordance with its economic situation, the petty bourgeoisie can have no policy of its own. It always oscillates between the capitalists and the workers. Its own upper stratum pushes it to the right; its lower strata, oppressed and exploited, are capable in certain conditions of turning sharply to the left. \nWhither France? (1934)\n\u00a0\nThese [Fascist] demagogues shake their fists at the bankers, the big merchants and the capitalists. Their words and gestures correspond to the feelings of the small proprietors bogged up a blind alley. The Fascists show boldness, go out into the streets, attack the police, and attempt to drive out parliament by force. That makes an impression on the despairing petty bourgeois. He says to himself: \u201cThe Radicals, among whom there are too many swindlers, have definitely sold themselves to the bankers; the Socialists have promised for a long time to abolish exploitation but they never pass from words to deeds, the Communists one cannot understand at all \u2013 today it is one thing tomorrow another; let\u2019s see if the Fascists cannot save us.\u201d \nWhither France?

The Soviet products are as though branded with the gray label of indifference.

(1932)\n\u00a0\nThe Jesuits represented a militant organization, strictly centralized, aggressive, and dangerous not only to enemies but also to allies. In his psychology and method of action the Jesuit of the heroicperiod distinguished himself from an average priest as the warrior of a church from its shopkeeper. We have no reason to idealize either one or the other. But it is altogether unworthy to look upon a fanatic warrior with the eyes of an obtuse and slothful shopkeeper. ...

It is an altogether different thing when a few thousand or even tens of thousands of revolutionists, who are truly Communists or only take the name, assume the leadership of a peasant war without having serious support from the proletariat. This is precisely the situation in China.\nProblems of the Chinese Revolution (1932)\n\u00a0\nOn the Fourth International\nThe strategic task of the Fourth International lies not in reforming capitalism but in its overthrow. The present epoch is distinguished not for the fact that it frees the revolutionary party from day-to-day work but because it permits this work to be carried on indissolubly with the actual tasks of the revolution.\nThe Fourth International does not discard the program of the old \u201cminimal\u201d demands to the degree to which these have preserved at least part of their vital forcefulness. Indefatigably, it defends the democratic rights and social conquests of the workers. But it carries on this day-to-day work within the framework of the correct actual, that is, revolutionary perspective. Insofar as the old, partial, \u201cminimal\u201d demands of the masses clash with the destructive and degrading tendencies of decadent capitalism - and this occurs at each step-the Fourth International advances a system of transitional demands, the essence of which is contained in the fact that ever more openly and decisively they will be directed against the very bases of the bourgeois regime. The old \u201cminimal program\u201d is superseded by the transitional program, the task of which lies in systematic mobilization of the masses for the proletarian revolution.\nTransitional Program (1938)\n\u00a0\nOn Conscription\nWe can\u2019t oppose compulsory military training by the bourgeois state just as we can\u2019t oppose compulsory education by the bourgeois state. Military training in our eyes is a part of education.\nOn Conscription (1940) \n\u00a0\nOn Britain\nThe British monarchy, hypocritical British conservatism, religiosity, servility, sanctimoniousness all this is old rags, rubbish, the refuse of centuries which we have no need for whatsoever.\nThrough What Stage Are We Passing? (1921)\n\u00a0\nOur class enemies [the British bourgeoisie] are empiricists, that is, they operate from one occasion to the next, guided not by the analysis of historical development, but by practical experience, routinism, rule of thumb, and instinct.\nMilitary Doctrine or Pseudo-Military Doctrinairism (1921)\n\u00a0\nThe social revolution is entirely based upon the growth of proletarian consciousness and on the faith of the proletariat in its own strength and in the party which is leading it. One may play a double game with the enemies of the proletariat, but not with the proletariat itself. Our party has made mistakes, together with the masses which it was leading. We have always quite openly acknowledged these mistakes to the masses.\nBetween Red and White (1922)\n\u00a0\nLet us declare frankly: the sincere and profound enthusiasm with which we contemplate the products of the British genius in the most varied spheres of human creative endeavour, only the more sharply and pitilessly accentuates the sincere and profound contempt with which we regard the spiritual narrow-mindedness, the theoretical banality and the lack of revolutionary dignity, which characterize the authorized leaders of British socialism. They are not the heralds of a new world; they are but the surviving relies of an old culture, which in their person expresses anxiety for its further fate. And the spiritual barrenness of these relics seems to be a sort of retribution for the profligate lavish past of bourgeois culture.\nBetween Red and White (1922)\n\u00a0\nThe principle, the end justifies the means, naturally raise the question \u201cand what justifies the end?\u201d In practical life as in the historical movement the end and the means constantly change places. A machine under construction is an \u201cend\u201d of production only that upon entering the factory it may become the \u201cmeans\u201d Democracy in certain periods is the end of the class struggle only that later it may be transformed into its \u201cmeans.\u201d \nTheir Morals and Ours (1938)\n\u00a0\nDespite all the indisputable greatness of Anglo-Saxon genius one cannot help observing that it is precisely in the Anglo-Saxon countries that the laws of revolution are least understood. This can be explained on the one hand by the fact that the phenomenon of revolution itself in these countries relates to a far distant past and evokes from the official \u201csociologists\u201d the condescending smile intended for a naughty child. On the other hand the pragmatism so characteristic of Anglo-Saxon thinking is of least avail for the understanding of revolutionary crises.\nThe Philosophy of British Capitalism (1938)\n\n\u00a0\n\nLeon Trotsky Internet Archive\n", "Our Soviet bureaucratic machine is unique, complex, containing as it does the traditions of different epochs together with the germs of future relationships. With us, civility, as a general rule, does not exist. But of rudeness, inherited from the past, we have as much as you please.\nCivility and Politeness as a Necessary Lubricant in Daily Relations (1923)", "There are two big facts which have set a new stamp on working class life. The one is the advent of the eight-hour working day; the other, the prohibition of the sale of vodka.\nVodka, the Church and the Cinema (1923)", "The workers\u2019 state must become wealthier in order that it may be possible seriously to tackle the public education of children and the releasing of the family from the burden of the kitchen and the laundry. Socialization of family housekeeping and public education of children are unthinkable without a marked improvement in our economics as a whole. We need more socialist economic forms. Only under such conditions can we free the family from the functions and cares that now oppress and disintegrate it. Washing must be done by a public laundry, catering by a public restaurant, sewing by a public workshop. Children must be educated by good public teachers who have a real vocation for the work. Then the bond between husband and wife would be freed from everything external and accidental, and the one would cease to absorb the life of the other. Genuine equality would at last be established.\nVodka, the Church and the Cinema (1923)", "A certain advance towards the new family is possible even now. It is true that the state cannot as yet undertake either the education of children or the establishment of public kitchens that would be an improvement on the family kitchen, or the establishment of public laundries where the clothes would not be torn or stolen. But this does not mean that the more enterprising and progressive families cannot group themselves even now into collective house keeping units. Experiments of this kind must, of course, be made carefully.\nVodka, the Church and the Cinema (1923)", "The proletariat has made a big stride, but more in politics than in life and morals. Life is conservative. In its primitive aspect, of course, Rasteryaev Street [referring to a book by Uspensky] no longer exists. The brutal treatment accorded to apprentices, the servility practiced before employers, the vicious drunkenness, and the street hooliganism have vanished. But in the relations of husband and wife, parents and children, in the domestic life of the family, fenced off from the whole world, Rasteryaevism is still firmly implanted. We need years and decades of economic growth and culture to banish Rasteryaevism from its last refuge \u2013 individual and family life \u2013 recreating it from top to bottom in the spirit of collectivism.\nHabit and Custom (1923)", "Abusive language and swearing are a legacy of slavery, humiliation, and disrespect for human dignity, one\u2019s own and that of other people.\nThe Struggle for Cultured Speech (1923)", "The husband, torn away from his usual surroundings by mobilization, changed into a revolutionary citizen at the civic front. A momentous change. His outlook is wider, his spiritual aspirations higher and of a more complicated order. He is a different man. And then he returns to find everything there practically unchanged. The old harmony and understanding with the people at home in family relationship is gone. No new understanding arises. The mutual wondering changes into mutual discontent, then into ill will. The family is broken up.\nFrom the Old Family to the New (1923)", "The workers state has rejected church ceremony, and informed its citizens that they have the right to be born, to marry, and to die without the mysterious gestures and exhortations of persons clad in cassocks, gowns, and other ecclesiastical vestments. But custom finds it harder to discard ceremony than the state.\nThe Family and Ceremony (1923)", "The dictatorship will have to become softer and milder as the economic welfare of the country is raised. The present method of commanding human beings will give way to one of disposing over things. The road leads not to the robot but to man of a higher order.\nFamily Relations Under the Soviets (1932)", "These gentlemen have, it seems, completely forgotten that socialism was to remove the cause which impels woman to abortion, and not force her into the \u201cjoys of motherhood.\u201d with the help of a foul police interference in what is to every woman the most intimate sphere of life.\nThermidor in the Family\u2014from Revolution Betrayed (1936)", "The place of the family as a shut-in petty enterprise was to be occupied, according to plans, by a finished system of social care and accommodation: maternity houses, creches, kindergartens, school and hospitals, sanatoria, athletic organisations, film theatres, etc. The complete absorption of the housekeeping functions of the family by institutions of the socialist society, uniting all generations in solidarity and mutual aid, was to bring women, and thereby to the loving couple, a real liberation from the thousand-year-old fetters.\nTrotsky, Thermidor in the Family\u2014from Revolution Betrayed (1936)", "Just as a blacksmith cannot seize the red hot iron in his naked hand, so the proletariat cannot directly seize the power; it has to have an organisation accommodated to this task. The co-ordination of the mass insurrection with the conspiracy, the subordination of the conspiracy to the insurrection, the organisation of the insurrection through the conspiracy, constitutes that complex and responsible department of revolutionary politics which Marx and Engels called \u201cthe art of insurrection.\u201d It presupposes a correct general leadership of the masses, a flexible orientation in changing conditions, a thought-out plan of attack, cautiousness in technical preparation, and a daring blow.\nHistory of the Russian Revolution, Chpter 30 (1930)", "Eclectics live by means of episodic thoughts and improvisations that originate under the impact of events.

Permitting such propaganda in a Communist Party is like permitting Tolstoyan propaganda in the garrison of a besieged fortress.\nIntroduction to the Military Writings (1923)", "With regard to countries with a belated bourgeois development, especially the colonial and semi-colonial countries, the theory of the permanent revolution signifies that the complete and genuine solution of their tasks of achieving democracy and national emancipation is conceivable only through the dictatorship of the proletariat as the leader of the subjugated nation, above all of its peasant masses.\nTheory of Permanent Revolution (1931)", "The dictatorship of the proletariat which has risen to power as the leader of the democratic revolution is inevitably and, very quickly confronted with tasks, the fulfillment of which is bound up with deep inroads into the rights of bourgeois property. The democratic revolution grows over directly into the socialist revolution and thereby becomes a permanent revolution.\nTheory of Permanent Revolution (1931)", "The utopian hopes of the epoch of military communism came in later for a cruel, and in many respects just, criticism. The theoretical mistake of the ruling party remains inexplicable, however, only if you leave out of account the fact that all calculations at that time were based on the hope of an early victory of the revolution in the West.\nRevolution Betrayed (1936)", "The completion of the socialist revolution within national limits is unthinkable.\nTheory of Permanent Revolution (1931)", "To say to the Social Democratic workers: \u201cCast your leaders aside and join our \u2018non-party\u2019 united front\u201d means to add just one more hollow phrase to a thousand others. We must understand how to tear the workers away from their leaders in reality. But reality today is the struggle against fascism. ... The overwhelming majority of the Social Democratic workers will fight against the fascists, but \u2013 for the present at least \u2013 only together with their organizations. This stage cannot be skipped. \nFor a Workers\u2019 United Front Against Fascism (1931)", "When a state turns fascist, it doesn\u2019t only mean that the forms and methods of government are changed in accordance with the patterns set by Mussolini \u2013 the changes in this sphere ultimately play a minor role \u2013 but it means, primarily and above all, that the workers\u2019 organizations are annihilated;  that the proletariat is reduced to an amorphous state; and that a system of \nadministration is created which penetrates deeply into the masses and which serves to frustrate the independent crystallization of the proletariat.  Therein precisely is the gist of fascism.\nWhat Next for the German Revolution? (1932)", "The progress of a class toward class consciousness, that is, the building of a revolutionary party which leads the proletariat, is a complex and a contradictory process. The class itself is not homogeneous. Its different sections arrive at class consciousness by different paths and at different times. The bourgeoisie participates actively in this process. Within the working class, it creates its own institutions, or utilizes those already existing, in order to oppose certain strata of workers to others. Within the proletariat several parties are active at the same time. Therefore, for the greater part of its historical journey, it remains split politically. The problem of the united front \u2013 which arises during certain periods most sharply originates therein.

First, it should be pointed out that the danger of ultrademocracy lies in the fact that it damages or even completely wrecks the Party organization and weakens or even completely undermines the Party's fighting capacity, rendering the Party incapable of fulfilling its fighting tasks and thereby causing the defeat of the revolution. Next, it should be pointed out that the source of ultra-democracy consists in the petty bourgeoisie's individualistic aversion to discipline. When this characteristic is brought into the Party, i t develops into ultra-democratic ideas politically and organizationally. These ideas are utterly incompatible with the fighting tasks of the proletariat.  \u201cOn Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party\u201d (December 1929), \tSelected Works, Vol. I, p. 108.

In the Party organization of the Red Army, however, criticism is not always of this character, and sometimes turns into personal attack. As a result, it damages the Party organization as well as individuals. This is a manifestation of petty-bourgeois individualism. The method of correction is to help Party members understand that the purpose of criticism is to increase the Party's fighting capacity in order to achieve victory in the class struggle and that it should not be used as a means of personal attack.  \u201cOn Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party\u201d (December 1929), \tSelected Works, Vol. I, p. 110.

One is its class nature: it openly avows that dialectical materialism is in the service of the proletariat. The other is its practicality: it emphasizes the dependence of theory on practice, emphasizes that theory is based on practice and in turn serves practice.\u201cOn Practice,\u201d (July 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 297.

Such people are bound to trip and fall.  \u201cOn Practice,\u201d (July 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 302.

This internal contradiction exists in every single thing, hence its motion and development. Contradictoriness within a thing is the fundamental cause of its development, while its interrelations and interactions with other things are secondary causes.  \u201cOn Contradiction,\u201d (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 313.

Therefore, in studying any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to finding its principal contradiction. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved.  \u201cOn Contradiction,\u201d (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 332.  (Mao)", "Of the two contradictory aspects, one must be principal and the other secondary. The principal aspect is the one playing the leading role in the contradiction. The nature of a thing is determined mainly by the principal aspect of a contradiction, the aspect that has gained the dominant position. But this situation is not static; the principal and the non-principal aspects of a contradiction transform themselves into each other and the nature of the thing changes accordingly.  \u201cOn Contradiction,\u201d (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 333. (Mao)", "While we recognize that in the general development of history the material determines the mental and social being determines social consciousness, we also - and indeed must - recognize the reaction of mental on material things, of social consciousness on social being and of the superstructure on the economic base. This does not go against materialism; on the contrary, it avoids mechanical materialism and firmly upholds dialectical materialism.  \u201cOn Contradiction,\u201d (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 336.  (Mao)", "Contradiction and struggle are universal and absolute, but the methods of resolving contradictions, that is, the forms of struggle, differ according to the differences in the nature of the contradictions. Some contradictions are characterized by open antagonism and others are not. In accordance with the concrete development of things, some contradictions, which were originally non-antagonistic, develop into antagonistic ones, while others which were originally antagonistic develop into non-antagonistic ones.  \u201cOn Contradiction,\u201d (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p 344.

We Communists oppose all unjust wars that impede progress, but we do not oppose progressive, just wars. Not only do we Communists not oppose just wars; we actively participate in them. As for unjust wars, World War I is an instance in which both sides fought for imperialist interests; therefore, the Communists of the whole world firmly opposed that war. The way to oppose a war of this kind is to do everything possible to prevent it before it breaks out and, once it breaks out, to oppose war with war, to oppose unjust war with just war, whenever possible.  \u201cOn Protracted War\u201d (May 1938), \tSelected Works, Vol. II, p. 150.
